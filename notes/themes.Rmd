# ggplot2 themes

The theming system in ggplot2 enables a user to control non-data elements of a ggplot object. It is composed of the following:

* theme _elements_, which refer to individual attributes of a graphic
  that are independent of the data, such as font size, axis ticks,
  appearance of grid lines or background color of a legend;

* theme _element functions_, which enables you to modify the settings
  of certain theme elements;

* theme _functions_, which define the settings of a collection of
  theme elements for the purpose of creating a specific style of
  graphics production;

* the `theme()` function, used to locally modify one or more theme
  elements in a specific ggplot object.

This chapter describes the new theming system introduced in version 0.9.2. We begin with a motivating example, and then turn to describe the new theming system in more detail.

## Motivating example

Consider the following simple scatterplot using the `mpg` data:

```{r theme-ex1}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(
    x = "City mileage/gallon",
    y = "Highway mileage/gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  )
```

Suppose we want to make the following modifications to this plot:

* change the default colors in the display
* increase the font size of the axis labels
* remove the minor grid lines on both axes
* add a plot title
* move the legend inside the graphics region
* change the background color of the graphics region

The first of these depends on the data itself, so we can use one of the `scale_colour_*()` functions for that purpose. The others influence the rendering of the graphic but are independent of the data being plotted. These are called _theme elements_, i.e., aspects of a ggplot object that are capable of modifying its appearance but are neither directly related to data nor aesthetics associated with data.

A list of theme elements and their default values can be gotten by calling the default theme function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
theme_grey()
```

The output of this call lists the properties of a ggplot object that can be accessed by users along with their default values, expressed as a list of lists. The `theme()` function allows you to locally modify properties of theme elements in a ggplot object.

One way of implementing the desired changes listed above is as follows, using the new theming system:

```{r theme-ex1a}
# Base plot
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(
    x = "City mileage/gallon",
    y = "Highway mileage/gallon",
    colour = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  scale_colour_brewer(type = "seq", palette = "Oranges")

# Use theme() to modify theme elements
p + labs(title = "Highway vs. city mileage per gallon") +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.key = element_rect(fill = "navy"),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    legend.position = c(0.14, 0.80),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey40"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "navy")
  )
```

The `element_xx()` functions modify theme elements with attributes (e.g., color, text size). Some theme elements are defined in terms of a unit of measurement, while others, such as `legend.position`, control the positioning of a theme element. These will be illustrated in greater detail in the examples to follow.

In the above call, `element_text()` modifies the `size` property of the `axis.text` theme element, `element_rect()` changes the fill color of the `legend.key`, `legend.background` and `panel.background` theme elements, `element_line()` alters the color of the major grid lines in both directions and `element_blank()` removes the minor grid lines from the display in both directions. Finally, the form of the `legend.position()` call moves the center of the legend grob to a position in coordinates relative to the size of the overall graphics device (not the graphics panel that delimits the graph itself). In this case, the default theme function is `theme_grey()`, so `theme()` locally changes the above settings in `theme_grey()` to the values specified in the call.

The equivalent code to produce the above graph in the old theming system is

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# version 0.9.1 or lower
p + opts(
  title = "Highway vs. city mileage per gallon",
  axis.text.x = theme_text(size = 14),
  axis.text.y = theme_text(size = 14),
  panel.grid.minor = theme_blank(),
  legend.position = c(0.14, 0.78),
  legend.key = theme_rect(fill = "navy"),
  legend.background = theme_rect(fill = "white"),
  panel.grid.major = theme_line(colour = "grey40"),
  panel.grid.minor = theme_blank(),
  panel.background = theme_rect(fill = "navy")
)
```

The default theme for **ggplot2** graphics is `theme_grey()`, but you can override it with another (complete) theme function. A second theme function built into the system is `theme_bw()`, which can be plugged in as a replacement for `theme_grey()` as follows:

```{r theme-bw-ex1}
p + labs(title = "Highway vs. city mileage per gallon") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.key = element_rect(fill = "navy"),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    legend.position = c(0.14, 0.80),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey40"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```
Adding `theme_bw()` to the `ggplot()` call means that `theme_bw` becomes the default theme for the created `ggplot` object. The call `theme_bw()` produces a theme object which can be modified with `theme()`.

## Why a new theming system?

As part of the evolution of ggplot2, the theming system has been renovated to improve code efficiency, support inheritance of theme element properties and to provide some new features. The most visible changes are summarized in the following table:

Legacy system    |    New system
-----------------|-------------------
`opts()`         |  `theme()`
`theme_xx()`     |  `element_xx()`

where `xx` is a placeholder for one of `text`, `rect` or `line`. The function `opts()` in the old system has been renamed `theme()` to emphasize its purpose; i.e., to locally modify theme elements in a ggplot object. Similarly, the old `theme_xx()` functions have been renamed `element_xx()` to clarify that their purpose is to modify characteristics of theme *elements*. One motivation for this change is to avoid confusion between functions that modify theme elements and functions that define themes, such as `theme_grey()`.

Some notable changes in the new theming system:

1.  Plot titles are handled differently in the new theming system. Define
    them within `labs()` using the `title = ` argument, or alternatively,
    with the `ggtitle()` function. However, the *properties* of plot
    titles are still controlled by the `plot.title` theme element.

1.  The new system recognizes the distinction between *complete* theme
    objects and *incomplete* theme objects. Typically, a call to `theme()`
    results in an incomplete theme object (since it locally modifies the
    current theme) whereas a call to a theme function such as `theme_grey()`
    or `theme_bw()` returns a complete theme object. In particular, complete
    themes are added in a `ggplot()` or `qplot()` call. This subject is
    taken up in greater depth in the last section of the chapter, as it
    is relevant to those who want to create their own ggplot2 theme
    functions.

1.  The object returned by a call to a complete theme function is now a
    nested list of theme elements and their properties, which enables the
    new theming system to support inheritance of properties. For example,
    to change the size of both axis labels in the motivating example, it
    is sufficient to type

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
    ```

    because it will be passed down to the theme elements `axis.text.x`
    and `axis.text.y` by inheritance.

1.  A happy consequence of inheritance is that it enables relative sizing
    in the new theming system. This allows size parameters to be set in top
    level theme elements and then modified on a relative rather than an
    absolute basis, potentially saving a significant amount of code.

1.  The old theme element functions `theme_line()` and `theme_segment()`
    have been merged into the new function `element_line()` as an
    efficiency measure.

We now turn attention to theme elements and the functions that modify their properties. We start with theme element functions, since they are relatively few in number and rather easy to understand. We then turn to consider groups of theme elements along with examples to illustrate how they can be applied.

## Theme element functions

Most theme elements have several properties that can be modified through a corresponding element function. The available functions are listed in the table below. For reference, their names under the old and new theming systems are placed side by side.

Legacy system                      |        New system
-----------------------------------|--------------------------
`theme_text()`                     |  `element_text()`
`theme_line()`, `theme_segment()`  |  `element_line()`
`theme_rect()`                     |  `element_rect()`
`theme_blank()`                    |  `element_blank()`

The `theme_segment()` function is dropped in the new theming system, its functionality being subsumed into `element_line()`. In the legacy theming system, `theme_line()` and `theme_segment()` had the same set of arguments, so merging them into one function is simply more efficient.

We now consider the individual theme element functions in more detail. The arguments of a given element function correspond to the attributes of any theme element to which it applies.

### `element_text()`

**Purpose**: To control the drawing of labels and headings.

The table below lists the arguments of `element_text()` and their corresponding default values.

Argument | Description | Default value
---------|-------------|--------------
family   | font family | ""
face     | font face   | "plain"
colour   | font color  | "black"
size     | font size (pts) | 10
hjust    | horizontal justification | 0.5
vjust    | vertical justification | 0.5
angle    | text angle  | 0
lineheight | line height | 1.1


### `element_line()`

**Purpose**: To draw lines and segments such as graphics region boundaries, axis tick marks and grid lines.

Argument  | Description | Default value
----------|-------------|--------------
colour    | line color  | "black"
size      | line thickness | 0.5
linetype  | type of line | 1


### `element_rect()`

**Purpose**: To draw rectangles. It is mostly used for background elements and legend keys.

Argument  | Description | Default value
----------|-------------|--------------
fill      | fill color  | NA (none)
colour    | border color | "black"
size      | thickness of border line | 0.5
linetype  | type of border line | 1 (solid)


### `element_blank()`

**Purpose**: To draw nothing.

Arguments: none.

The `element_blank()` function can be applied to any theme element controlled by a theme element function.

With these functions in place, we now turn to the theme elements themselves.

## Theme elements

The default theme function `theme_grey()` contains 38 individual theme elements. The first three of these are `line`, `rect` and `text`, whose default properties are defined through their respective theme element functions `element_line()`, `element_rect()` and `element_text()`. The remaining theme elements can be grouped in various ways, but we have chosen the following: elements associated with axis, legends, panel strips, graphics panels and the entire plot region.

### Axis attributes

The table below lists each theme element associated with the rendering of axes, the theme function or unit function that controls it, and a short description of the element.

Element             | Theme function | Unit    | Description
--------------------|----------------|---------|------------
axis.line           | line           |         | line parallel to axis
axis.text           | text           |         | tick labels
axis.text.x         | text           |         | x-axis tick labels
axis.text.y         | text           |         | y-axis tick labels
axis.title          | text           |         | axis titles
axis.title.x        | text           |         | x-axis title
axis.title.y        | text           |         | y-axis title
axis.ticks          | line           |         | axis tick marks
axis.ticks.length   |                | cm      | length of tick marks
axis.ticks.margin   |                | cm      | width of axis tick margin

Most of the theme elements listed above use theme element functions to modify their properties. However, the length and margin of axis ticks are set to individual values relative to a defined unit of measurement; e.g., `unit(0.5, "cm")`. The `unit()` function comes from the **grid** package, so **grid** should be loaded along with **ggplot2** if you intend to (re)set theme elements defined in terms of measurement units.

Our first example shows how to modify axis lines. The properties of the `axis.line` theme element are exactly the same as the arguments of the function `element_line()`; therefore, the function is used to modify properties of `axis.line`. (This is true for any theme element controlled by an element function.)

The first call below changes each of the available properties in the `axis.line` theme element so that the changes propagate to both `axis.line.x` and `axis.line.y`, taking advantage of inheritance. The plot on the left therefore has axis lines with long dashes of thickness 2 in red in both the `x` and `y` directions.

The second call uses inheritance somewhat differently. The attributes changed in `axis.line` propagate to both `axis.line.x` and `axis.line.y`. However, in the second line of code corresponding to `axis.line.y`,  the specified color and linetype override the values inherited from `axis.line`. As a result, in the right hand plot, `axis.line.x` will be a solid blue line with thickness 2 while `axis.line.y` will be a dashed orange line with the same thickness.

```{r axis-line-ex}
p + theme(
  axis.line = element_line(colour = "red", size = 2, linetype = "longdash")
)

p + theme(
  axis.line = element_line(colour = "blue", size = 2),
  axis.line.y = element_line(colour = "orange", linetype = "dashed")
)
```

The following code chunk illustrates how to modify properties of the axis tick labels, associated with the `axis.text` theme element, through the `element_text()` function. Like the previous example, the first call applies to both axis tick labels (left plot), while the second call provides additional modifications to the y-axis label (right), including a relative size reduction.

```{r axis-text-ex}
p + theme(
  axis.text = element_text(color = "blue", size = 15, face = "italic")
)

p + theme(
  axis.text = element_text(colour = "blue", size = 15, face = "italic"),
  axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, size = rel(0.7), hjust = 0)
)
```

The code chunk below modifies properties of axis ticks, including some modifications involving measurement units.

```{r axis-ticks-ex}
p + theme(
  axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "purple", size = 1),
  axis.ticks.length = unit(0.5, "cm")
)

# double the relative size of axis ticks in the x direction
p + theme(
  axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "violet"),
  axis.ticks.x = element_line(size = rel(2)),
  axis.ticks.margin = unit(0.4, "in")
)
```

The last code chunk in this subsection shows how to modify attributes of the axis titles.

```{r axis-title-ex}
p + theme(
  axis.title = element_text(size = 20, color = "maroon"),
  axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 1, angle = 30, face = "bold")
)

p + theme(
  axis.title = element_text(size = 20, color = "maroon"),
  axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 0, angle = 120, face = "bold",
    size = rel(0.5))
)
```

### Legend attributes

The following theme elements are associated with the appearance of legends:

Element             | Theme function | Unit    | Default value |Description
--------------------|----------------|---------|---------------|-----------
legend.background   |  rect          |         |               | legend background
legend.key          |  rect          |         |               | background of legend keys
legend.key.size     |                | lines   |               |
legend.key.height   |                | cm      |               | legend key height
legend.key.width    |                | cm      |               | legend key width
legend.margin       |                | lines   |               | legend margin
legend.text         |  text          |         |               | legend labels
legend.text.align   |                |         | NULL          | legend label alignment
legend.title        |  text          |         |               | legend name
legend.title.align  |                |         | NULL          | legend name alignment
legend.position     |                |         | "right"       | position of legend
legend.direction    |                |         | NULL          | direction of legend keys
legend.justification |               |         | "center"      | justification of legend
legend.box          |                |         | NULL          | position of multiple legend boxes

As with axis-related theme elements, some are associated with theme element functions and some with measurement units. However,
several theme elements associated with legends also modify position, and these are indicated by non-empty values in the column headed `Default value`.

if `legend.position` is set by a numeric vector, then the element `legend.justification` can be applied; it controls the position of the anchor point of the legend grob.

The following table summarizes the possible values for each legend theme element associated with positioning:

Theme element                    | Potential values
---------------------------------|-----------------------------
legend.direction, legend.box     |  "vertical", "horizontal"
legend.position                  | "top", "bottom", "left", "right" "none"
legend.justification             | 1st value: "left", "center", "right"
                                 | 2nd value: "top", "center", "bottom"

`legend.position` and (conditionally) `legend.justification` also accept two-element numeric vectors of the form `c(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` take values between 0 and 1. Theme elements `legend.title.align` and `legend.text.align` also assume values between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to left and 1 to right.

Theme elements associated with legends fall roughly into two groups: those that modify the position of the legend grob and those that modify properties of the legend grob. We begin with elements that modify position.

The first step is to create a simple data frame that generates a base plot with a single legend.

```{r legend-ex-data}
# toy data frame
DF1 <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, gp = factor(rep(1:2, each = 5)))
# base ggplot object
p0 <- ggplot(DF1, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = gp)) + geom_point()
```

The following code chunk illustrates different ways of positioning the legend in a ggplot. The coordinates of the last call represent relative (or proportional) location on the graphics device where the legend is to be placed.

```{r legend-position-ex}
p0 + theme(legend.position = "top") + ggtitle("Top")
p0 + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + ggtitle("Bottom")
p0 + theme(legend.position = "left") + ggtitle("Left")
p0 + theme(legend.position = "none") + ggtitle("None")
p0 + theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.8)) + ggtitle("Inside")
p0 + ggtitle("Default")
```

When a legend is positioned in terms of relative `(x, y)` location, one can use the `legend.justification` theme element. It indicates which part of the legend grob is positioned at `(x, y)` (the default is `c("center", "center")`). If only one argument is given, such as in the first call below, it is implicit that `y` will be in the vertical center of the grob. If you want to justify the legend grob vertically, you have to use "center" as the first value in a two-element character vector, as in the third call below.

```{r legend-just-ex1}
p0 +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = "left") +
  labs(title = "Left justified")

p0 +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = "right") +
  labs(title = "Right justified")

p0 +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5),
    legend.justification = c("center", "top")) +
  labs(title = "Center top justified")

p0 +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5),
    legend.justification = c("left", "bottom")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Bottom left justified")
```

One can also specify legend justification with respect to a numeric vector of length 2:

```{r legend-just-ex3}
p0 + theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = c(0.2, 0.8))
p0 + theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = c(0.6, 0.3))
```

The direction of a legend can either be horizontal or vertical, and you can achieve different looks by combining `legend.position` with `legend.direction`, as the following examples show.

```{r legend-direction-ex}
p0 + theme(legend.position = "top")
p0 + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.direction = "vertical")
```

The `legend.box` theme element applies only when more than one legend grob is drawn in a ggplot. The code below sets up another toy example with two aesthetics and separate legends and then uses `legend.box` to arrange the legends either vertically or horizontally.

```{r legend-box-base}
DF2 <- data.frame(
  x = seq_len(20),
  y = rnorm(20),
  gp1 = factor(rep(1:2, each = 10)),
  gp2 = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 5))
)
# base plot
q0 <- ggplot(DF2, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = gp1, shape = gp2)) +
  geom_point(size = 3)

q0
q0 + theme(legend.position = "top")
q0 + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.box = "horizontal")
q0 + theme(legend.box = "horizontal")
q0 + theme(legend.direction = "horizontal", legend.box = "vertical")
```

We now turn to consideration of legend theme elements that are associated with the legend grob itself. We begin with an example that shows how to modify the legend background:

```{r legend-background-ex}
p0 +
  theme(
    legend.background = element_rect(
      fill = "lemonchiffon",
      color = "black",
      size = 2,
      linetype = "longdash"
    )
  )
```

The code chunk below shows two ways of modifying the size of a legend key. The first call uses equal key width and key height (left)while the second call allows one to specify key width and key height independently (right).

```{r legend-key-ex}
p0 + theme(
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "black", colour = "yellow"),
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "in")
)
p0 + theme(
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "yellow", color = "orange"),
  legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "in"),
  legend.key.height = unit(0.2, "in")
)
```

This code chunk illustrates how one can modify the legend key labels and then to modify the justification of the legend text.

```{r legend-text-ex}
p0 + theme(legend.text = element_text(
  face = "bold", size = 15, angle = 90, colour = "magenta"
))
last_plot() + theme(legend.text.align = 1)
```

The next example modifies properties of the legend title. The second call shows that the `legend.title.align` element doesn't work in the release candidate: the title disappears altogether, just as the legend key labels disappear when  `legend.text.align` is invoked.

```{r legend-title-ex}
p0 + theme(legend.title =
    element_text(face = "italic", size = 12, angle = 45, color = "grey70") )
last_plot() + theme(legend.title.align = 0)
```


### Panel attributes

Panel elements are associated with the graphics region in a ggplot. In faceted ggplots, these elements apply uniformly to each graphics panel.

Element           | Theme function  | Unit  | Description
------------------|-----------------|-------|------------
panel.background  | rect            |       | background of graphics region
panel.border      | rect            |       | border of graphics region
panel.grid.major  | line            |       | major grid lines
panel.grid.minor  | line            |       | minor grid lines
panel.margin      |                 | lines | margin between facets

In the new theming system, both `panel.grid.major` and `panel.grid.minor` can be controlled in either the `x` or `y` direction. This will be illustrated in the examples below.

The first code chunk below compares the modifications to a graphics panel that take place when `panel.background` is called vis a vis `panel.border`. Both theme elements are modified by `element_rect()`, but the same calls to `element_rect()` produce very different outcomes.

```{r panel-bkgd-ex}
p + theme(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "navy", color = "orange", size = 2)
)
p + theme(
  panel.border = element_rect(fill = "navy", colour = "orange", size = 2)
)
```
This occurs because `panel.border` differs from `panel.background`: the former is implemented by drawing a rectangle on *top* of the graphics panel. The fix is to set the fill color to NA:

```{r panel-border-fix}
p + theme(
  panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = "orange", size = 2)
)
```

The next set of examples modifies the major and minor grid lines in a ggplot. The advantage gained by inheritance in the new theming system is that one can now modify grid lines in one direction.

The first call below modifies the color and thickness of the major grid lines in both directions, but then eliminates the major grid lines in the `x` direction only using `element_blank()`, which is used to suppress drawing of a particular theme element. The second call eliminates the minor grid lines in both directions, since both `panel.grid.minor.x` and `panel.grid.minor.y` inherit from `panel.grid.minor`. The last call modifies the linetype of the minor grid lines in both directions, and modifies the background fill color to make the change more apparent.

```{r panel-grid-ex}
p + theme(
  panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray60", size = 0.8),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
  legend.position = "none"
)

p + theme(
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
)

p + theme(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"),
  panel.grid.minor = element_line(linetype = "dotted"),
  legend.position = "none"
)
```

Theme element `panel.margin` is concerned with the amount of spacing between panels in a faceted ggplot. The first step is to generate a faceted plot using the `mtcars` data after which the spacing between facets is modified.

```{r panel-margin-ex}
s <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(vs ~ am, labeller = label_both)

s + theme(panel.margin = unit(0.5, "in"))
```

### Strip attributes

The following theme elements are associated with panel strips in faceted ggplots:

Theme element         | Theme function | Description
----------------------|----------------|------------
strip.background      | rect           | background of panel strips
strip.text.x          | text           | horizontal strip text
strip.text.y          | text           | vertical strip text

Element `strip.text.x` can be used in either `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`, but `strip.text.y` can only be used in connection with `facet_grid()`.

The first example modifies the background features of panel strips.

```{r strip-background-ex}
s + theme(
  strip.background = element_rect(fill = "cornsilk", color = "maroon", size = 2)
)
```

Theme elements `strip.text.x` and `strip.text.y` both inherit from theme element `strip.text`, as shown in the example below. The modifications to `strip.text` propagate by default to both `strip.text.x` and `strip.text.y`, but the second line changes the font face in `strip.text.y`. A bit of `panel.margin` is added to space out the vertical axis labels a little.

```{r strip-text-ex}
s + theme(
  strip.text = element_text(face = "italic", size = 15, colour = "red"),
  strip.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
  panel.margin = unit(0.25, "cm")
)
```

### Plot attributes

These elements pertain to the entire graphics region of a ggplot, but particularly outside a graphics panel (or the set of panels in a faceted plot).

Element               | Theme function |  Unit  | Description
----------------------|----------------|--------|------------
plot.background       | rect           |        | background of entire plot
plot.title            | text           |        | plot title
plot.margin           |                |  cm    | vector of margins around plot

Element `plot.margin` is a four-element vector associated with the margins to be placed outside the graphics region going clockwise from the top.

As noted earlier in this chapter, there are two new ways to produce a plot title: `ggtitle()` and the `title = ` argument of `labs()`. The `title` element in the legacy theming system is deprecated. An example of each is shown in the figures below. These examples show how to modify the properties of a plot title; the second one shows how to add some space between the panel border and the plot title using the `vjust` attribute.

```{r plot-title-ex}
p + ggtitle("Plot title") + theme(
  plot.title = element_text(
    colour = "blue",
    size = 20,
    hjust = 0.2,
    vjust = 0.8,
    angle = 180
  )
)

p +
  labs(title = "Plot title") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, vjust = 2))
```

The theme element `plot.background` modifies properties of the entire graphics region of a ggplot.

```{r plot-bkgrd-ex}
q0 + theme(
  plot.background = element_rect(
    fill = "lightblue",
    colour = "black",
    size = 2,
    linetype = "longdash")
  )
```

The `plot.margin` theme element controls the amount of space between the panel border and the edge of the graphics device region. It takes a four-element numeric vector as the first argument of `unit()`, corresponding to the top, right, bottom and left sides of the plot region. The border around the graphics region provides a reference against which to judge the size of the margins in each direction.

```{r plot-margin-ex}
q0 + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(2, 0.5, 1, 1), "in"),
           plot.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size = 1))
q0 + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 2, 3, 4), "cm"),
           plot.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size = 1))
```

Finally, one can use the theming system to modify the aspect ratio of a ggplot. Here are a couple of examples:

```{r aspect-ratio-ex}
q0 + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
q0 + theme(aspect.ratio = 0.25)
```

## Theme functions

A theme function is an R function in ggplot2 that sets or parameterizes a collection of theme elements. By contrast, a theme *object* is the result of calling a theme function inside a ggplot() call. Although the default themes in **ggplot2** produce attractive graphics, they may not necessarily correspond with user requirements. If you find yourself modifying the same theme elements repeatedly with `theme()` or need to adapt a set of theme elements to conform to the requirements of a journal or other publication, then you should consider writing your own theme function.

The purpose of a theme function is to either specify default settings for each theme element or modify the settings of an existing (complete) theme function to produce a new theme. For example, the foundational `theme_grey` function specifies default settings of each theme element, whereas `theme_bw` is a modification of `theme_grey`. There are several ways to write new theme functions, but some features that debut in the new theming system need to be discussed first.

### Built-in theme functions: old and new

The primary differences between theme objects in the old and the new theming system are these:

1.  The old system contained 33 theme elements, while the new system has 38.
    The new theme elements are `line`, `rect`, `text`, `axis.text` and
    `strip.text`.

2.  Theme objects in the old theming system were lists, whose components
    were associated with each of the theme elements. The values of the
    components were either theme element functions with specified arguments
    or vectors (often of length 1) expressed in a unit of measurement. For
    example, the first few components of the theme object `theme_grey()`
    [note the evaluation of the function] under the old theming system are

    ```
    > theme_grey()
    $axis.line
    theme_blank()

    $axis.text.x
    theme_text(family = base_family, colour = "grey50", size = base_size *
        0.8, vjust = 1, lineheight = 0.9)

    $axis.text.y
    theme_text(family = base_family, colour = "grey50", size = base_size *
        0.8, hjust = 1, lineheight = 0.9)

    $axis.ticks
    theme_segment(colour = "grey50")

    $axis.title.x
    theme_text(family = base_family, size = base_size, vjust = 0.5)

    $axis.title.y
    theme_text(family = base_family, size = base_size, vjust = 0.5,
        angle = 90)

    $axis.ticks.length
    [1] 0.15cm
    ```

    In the new theming system, theme objects are nested lists; more
    specifically, the output of the theme element functions is returned for
    each theme element that is controlled by an element function. The first
    few components of `scale_grey()` under the new system:

    ```{r}
    theme_grey()[1:5]
    ```

3.  Inheritance of theme elements is supported in the new theming system.
    The first three elements in the new theme object are `text`, `line` and
    `rect`, which, not coincidentally, are the same as the names of the
    basic theme element functions. In fact, the (default) values of the
    arguments to these functions comprise list objects from which other theme
    elements may inherit. For example, the theme elements `axis.text`,
    `legend.text`, `strip.text` and `axis.title` all inherit from `text`,
    while `axis.text.x` and `axis.text.y` further inherit from `axis.text`.
    This means the values of the components of the theme element `text` are
    passed on to `axis.text` as well as other elements that inherit from `text`
    or its children. You can override the default values of one or more
    theme elements by calling `theme()` and modifying the desired properties
    of theme elements therein.

4.  Because of the inheritance properties available in the new theming system,
    it is now possible to apply relative sizing. For example, since `text.axis`
    inherits from `text`, one can define the size of axis tick labels to be
    half that of the defined text size under the new system with code like
    the following:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(0.5)))
    ```

5.  Because of the inheritance properties associated with theme elements
    under the new system, it is possible to control the `x` and `y` components
    of the following theme elements individually with `theme()`:

    ```
    panel.grid.major
    panel.grid.minor
    axis.ticks
    axis.line
    ```

    Under the old theming system, only the `axis.ticks` element had `x` and
    `y` components. The new theming system allows for richer inheritance
    structures. Here's an example that will warm the hearts of those who have
    had to write code to remove the grid lines from one dimension of a graphic
    in the legacy system.

    ```{r grid-lines-ex}
    # require("ggplot2")
    DF <- data.frame(x = seq_len(10), y = seq_len(10))
    ggplot(DF, aes(x, y)) + theme_bw() + geom_blank() +
        theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
              panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
    ```

    This example sets the font size in `axis.text` and modifies it for
    `axis.text.y`:

    ```{r axis.text-ex}
    ggplot(DF, aes(x, y)) + theme_bw() + geom_blank() +
        theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
              axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5), angle = 90))
    ```

The following graphic summarises the inheritance structure:

![Inheritance structure](theme-inheritance.png)

### Complete and incomplete theme objects

In the new theming system, it is useful to understand the difference between complete and incomplete theme objects. A *complete* theme object is one produced by calling a theme function with the attribute `complete = TRUE`. A corresponding theme function with this attribute is also said to be complete. Theme functions `theme_grey` and `theme_bw` are examples of complete theme functions. Calls to `theme()` produce *incomplete* theme objects, since they represent (local) modifications to a theme object rather than returning a complete theme object per se.

To clarify the above points, consider the following examples:

```{r test-complete1}
attr(theme_grey(), "complete")
attr(theme(text = element_text(colour = "red")), "complete")
```

When adding an incomplete theme to a complete one, the result is a complete theme:

```{r test-complete2}
attr(theme_grey() +
  theme(text = element_text(colour = "red")), "complete")
attr(theme(text = element_text(colour = "red")) + theme_grey(),
     "complete")
```

Therefore, using `theme()` to locally modify the settings of theme elements in a complete theme object results in a complete theme object. Moreover, we will see below that the same game can be played to produce new complete theme functions.

When adding two incomplete themes, the result is incomplete:

```{r test-complete3}
attr(theme(text = element_text(colour = "red")) +
     theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "blue")), "complete")
```

Complete and incomplete themes behave somewhat differently when added to a ggplot object. When adding an incomplete theme object to a ggplot, it is in effect augmenting the current default theme object, replacing only those properties of elements defined in the call to `theme()`. In particular, any NULL element properties specified in `theme()` are ignored and do not affect the plot's appearance. This is because the `+` operator cannot be used to set properties of a theme element to NULL.

```{r null-ex}
# Set the default theme
theme_set(theme_grey())
# Modify it with theme()
tt <- theme(axis.text = element_text(size=14, colour=NULL))

# theme_grey has axis.text$colour="grey50"
# Adding tt does not reset the colour to NULL
# (which would result in black text for the axis labels)
qplot(1:3, 1:3) + tt
```

This feature can be problematic when you want to *replace* the default theme entirely. For example, suppose the default theme object is `theme_grey()` and you want to *add* `theme_bw()` to it, where for the purpose of this discussion, we pretend the latter is an incomplete theme object. Certain element properties are non-NULL in `theme_grey()` but NULL in `theme_bw()`. If you do something like `qplot(1:3, 1:3) + theme_bw()`, the properties set to NULL in `theme_bw()` are not reset in the `ggplot` theme object -- they simply carry over from the default theme object `theme_grey()`.

To deal with this problem, the concept of a complete theme (object) was introduced in the new theming system. In particular, `theme_grey` and `theme_bw` are both complete theme functions and return complete theme objects when called. When added to a plot, a complete theme object overrides the current default theme and in fact *replaces* it. This idea is implemented by endowing a theme function with the attribute `"complete"`: its value is `TRUE` for complete themes and `FALSE` for incomplete themes. Examples are shown in the next section.

### Modifying a theme function

There is a crucial distinction between a theme *function* and a theme *object*. A theme function defines settings for theme elements, whereas a theme object is the result of calling a theme function in **ggplot2**.

Here is an example of modifying an existing theme object:

```{r}
themeMod <- theme_grey() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Times", colour = "blue", size = 14))
```

Modifying an existing theme is not the same as creating a new theme. In this example, `themeMod` is a complete theme *object* but it is not a complete theme *function*. The `+` operator is typically used to modify complete theme objects created by applying the default or replacement theme function to a `ggplot` object. The `%+replace%` operator is primarily used to create new themes. For example,

```{r}
# Only change the 'colour' property of theme element 'text'
mytheme1 <- theme_grey() + theme(text = element_text(colour="red"))
mytheme1$text

# Replace the 'text' element entirely
mytheme2 <- theme_grey() %+replace% theme(text = element_text(colour="red"))
mytheme2$text
```

`mytheme1` is a complete theme object because an incomplete theme object is added to the complete theme object produced by `theme_grey()`. In contrast, `mytheme2` is a complete theme function whose `text` element is redefined in its entirety, setting all properties not defined in `element_text()` to NULL. Therefore, when using the `%+replace%` operator to create a new theme function, you need to be very careful about replacing theme elements at the top of the inheritance hierarchy such as `text`, `line` and `rect`.

The theme function `theme_grey` illustrates how to create a complete theme function under the new theming system by specifying the settings of each theme element in turn:

```{r theme-grey}
theme_grey
```

The last line, `complete = TRUE`, sets the attribute `complete` of the theme function to `TRUE`. To see the result of this theme, type `theme_grey()` at the prompt.

The `%+replace%` operator is illustrated in the complete theme function `theme_bw`:

```{r theme-bw}
theme_bw
```

Notice that the theme elements replaced in `theme_bw` primarily have NULL properties in `theme_grey()` since most of the default properties in the latter are defined in elements `rect`, `line` and `text` and passed down to their child elements. The `%+replace%` operator is used to set non-NULL properties in the selected elements specified in `theme()` with all undeclared properties set to NULL. This means you need to apply the `%+replace%` operator judiciously when creating new theme functions piggy-backed off of `theme_grey`.

### Examples of user-defined theme functions

The first example, `theme_black`, illustrates writing a theme function in the style of `theme_grey` - i.e., each theme element is specified individually.

```{r theme-black}
theme_black <- function(base_size = 12, base_family = "Helvetica") {
    theme(
    line =               element_line(colour = "black", size = 0.5, linetype = 1,
                            lineend = "butt"),
    rect =               element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "black", size = 0.5, linetype = 1),
    text =               element_text(family = base_family, face = "plain",
                            colour = "black", size = base_size,
                            hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, angle = 0, lineheight = 0.9),
    axis.text =          element_text(size = rel(0.8), colour = "white"),
    strip.text =         element_text(size = rel(0.8), colour = "white"),

    axis.line =          element_blank(),
    axis.text.x =        element_text(vjust = 1),
    axis.text.y =        element_text(hjust = 1),
    axis.ticks =         element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.2),
    axis.title =         element_text(colour = "white"),
    axis.title.x =       element_text(vjust = 1),
    axis.title.y =       element_text(angle = 90),
    axis.ticks.length =  unit(0.3, "lines"),
    axis.ticks.margin =  unit(0.5, "lines"),

    legend.background =  element_rect(colour = NA),
    legend.margin =      unit(0.2, "cm"),
    legend.key =         element_rect(fill = "black", colour = "white"),
    legend.key.size =    unit(1.2, "lines"),
    legend.key.height =  NULL,
    legend.key.width =   NULL,
    legend.text =        element_text(size = rel(0.8), colour = "white"),
    legend.text.align =  NULL,
    legend.title =       element_text(size = rel(0.8), face = "bold", hjust = 0, colour = "white"),
    legend.title.align = NULL,
    legend.position =    "right",
    legend.direction =   "vertical",
    legend.justification = "center",
    legend.box =         NULL,

    panel.background =   element_rect(fill = "black", colour = NA),
    panel.border =       element_rect(fill = NA, colour = "white"),
    panel.grid.major =   element_line(colour = "grey20", size = 0.2),
    panel.grid.minor =   element_line(colour = "grey5", size = 0.5),
    panel.margin =       unit(0.25, "lines"),

    strip.background =   element_rect(fill = "grey30", colour = "grey10"),
    strip.text.x =       element_text(),
    strip.text.y =       element_text(angle = -90),

    plot.background =    element_rect(colour = "black", fill = "black"),
    plot.title =         element_text(size = rel(1.2)),
    plot.margin =        unit(c(1, 1, 0.5, 0.5), "lines"),

    complete = TRUE
  )
}
# Check that it is a complete theme
attr(theme_black(), "complete")
# Apply it
qplot(1:10, 1:10, geom = "point", colour = I("yellow")) + theme_black()
```

An example of a theme function whose definition employs the `%+replace` operator in the new theming system is one that removes all of the borders, text, grid lines, axis ticks and axis labels. It is called `theme_nothing`, authored by David Kahle under the old theming system. To reproduce its effect in the new system, rewrite it as follows:

```{r theme-nothing}
theme_nothing <- function(base_size = 12, base_family = "Helvetica")
  {
  theme_bw(base_size = base_size, base_family = base_family) %+replace%
      theme(
            rect             = element_blank(),
            line             = element_blank(),
            text             = element_blank(),
            axis.ticks.margin = unit(0, "lines")
           )
  }
# check that it is a complete theme
attr(theme_nothing(), "complete")
# Apply it:
qplot(1:10, 1:10) + theme_nothing()
```
